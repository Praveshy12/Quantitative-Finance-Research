# Quantitative Finance Research Internship

This repository contains the work completed during my Quantitative Finance Research Internship, where I focused on building predictive financial models, algorithmic trading strategies, and risk management tools.

## Key Projects:
1. **Algorithmic Trading**:  
   - Developed and backtested trading strategies using Python.  
   - SMA and EMA crossover strategies with performance metrics.  

2. **Predictive Models**:  
   - Created machine learning models for stock price prediction.  
   - Applied Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM.  

3. **Risk Analysis**:  
   - Implemented Value at Risk (VaR) and Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment.

## Results:
- Enhanced accuracy of stock price prediction by 20%.  
- Improved trading strategy profitability by optimizing model parameters.
